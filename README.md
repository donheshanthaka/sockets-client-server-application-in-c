# sockets-client-server-application-in-c
This is an implementation of a simple client server application in c that handles one client through sockets API

Instruction:

* Make sure to change the IP variable inside the client code to your IPV4 address.
eg: unsigned long IP = "192.165.1.101";

* Run the server side code first and then client to initialize the connection.
* You will be able to type text messages on to the client side console, then it will be printed on the server side.
